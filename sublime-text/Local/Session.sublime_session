By default Sublimerge's colors theme conforms to default Sublime Text theme. If you are using some\n     custom theme and find the colors poorly visible, you may need to change them.\n\n  2. If you're on Windows and want to use VCS-related commands, you may need to configure the executable\n     path for your VCS. Linux and OS X users with non-standard VCS installation may need to configure this too.\n\n\n  Please visit http://www.sublimerge.com/sm3/docs/configuration.html for more information about configuration.\n\n\n\n  Simplified usage instructions\n  =============================\n\n  In file view:\n\n      [ctrl]+[alt]+[d]                      - display Quick Panel with commands available for current view\n\n\n  In diff view:\n\n      Windows/Linux:\n\n      [ctrl]+[down]                         - select next change\n      [ctrl]+[up]                           - select previous change\n    * [ctrl]+[left]                         - copy selected change (or active line) to left from right\n    * [ctrl]+[right]                        - copy selected change (or active line) to right from left\n      [ctrl]+[shift]+[left]                 - copy all changes to left from right\n      [ctrl]+[shift]+[right]                - copy all changes to right from left\n\n      OSX:\n\n      [alt]+[down]                          - select next change\n      [alt]+[up]                            - select previous change\n    * [alt]+[left]                          - copy selected change (or active line) to left from right\n    * [alt]+[right]                         - copy selected change (or active line) to right from left\n      [alt]+[shift]+[left]                  - copy all changes to left from right\n      [alt]+[shift]+[right]                 - copy all changes to right from left\n\n      Common:\n\n      [f3]                                  - swap panels\n      [f4]                                  - show changes navigator\n      [f5]                                  - recompare buffers\n\n    * - if change is selected the command will copy its whole contents, otherwise will copy only the focused line\n\n\n  In directories diff view:\n\n      [down]                              - select next file/directory\n      [up]                                - select previous file/directory\n      [left]                              - copy file/directory from right to left\n      [right]                             - copy file/directory from left to right\n      [enter]                             - enter sub directory / compare text files\n      [backspace]                         - enter parent directory\n\n\n      Windows/Linux:\n\n      [ctrl]+[down]                       - select next different file/directory\n      [ctrl]+[up]                         - select previous different file/directory\n\n\n      OS X:\n\n      [alt]+[down]                        - select next different file/directory\n      [alt]+[up]                          - select previous different file/directory\n\n\n      For convenience Sublimerge also supports standard OS X keyboard shortcuts for directories navigation:\n\n      [cmd]+[down]                        - enter sub directory / compare text files\n      [cmd]+[up]                          - enter parent directory\n\n\n\n  End-User License Agreement (EULA)\n  =================================\n\n  1.

By default Sublimerge's colors theme conforms to default Sublime Text theme. If you are using some\n     custom theme and find the colors poorly visible, you may need to change them.\n\n  2. If you're on Windows and want to use VCS-related commands, you may need to configure the executable\n     path for your VCS. Linux and OS X users with non-standard VCS installation may need to configure this too.\n\n\n  Please visit http://www.sublimerge.com/sm3/docs/configuration.html for more information about configuration.\n\n\n\n  Simplified usage instructions\n  =============================\n\n  In file view:\n\n      [ctrl]+[alt]+[d]                      - display Quick Panel with commands available for current view\n\n\n  In diff view:\n\n      Windows/Linux:\n\n      [ctrl]+[down]                         - select next change\n      [ctrl]+[up]                           - select previous change\n    * [ctrl]+[left]                         - copy selected change (or active line) to left from right\n    * [ctrl]+[right]                        - copy selected change (or active line) to right from left\n      [ctrl]+[shift]+[left]                 - copy all changes to left from right\n      [ctrl]+[shift]+[right]                - copy all changes to right from left\n\n      OSX:\n\n      [alt]+[down]                          - select next change\n      [alt]+[up]                            - select previous change\n    * [alt]+[left]                          - copy selected change (or active line) to left from right\n    * [alt]+[right]                         - copy selected change (or active line) to right from left\n      [alt]+[shift]+[left]                  - copy all changes to left from right\n      [alt]+[shift]+[right]                 - copy all changes to right from left\n\n      Common:\n\n      [f3]                                  - swap panels\n      [f4]                                  - show changes navigator\n      [f5]                                  - recompare buffers\n\n    * - if change is selected the command will copy its whole contents, otherwise will copy only the focused line\n\n\n  In directories diff view:\n\n      [down]                              - select next file/directory\n      [up]                                - select previous file/directory\n      [left]                              - copy file/directory from right to left\n      [right]                             - copy file/directory from left to right\n      [enter]                             - enter sub directory / compare text files\n      [backspace]                         - enter parent directory\n\n\n      Windows/Linux:\n\n      [ctrl]+[down]                       - select next different file/directory\n      [ctrl]+[up]                         - select previous different file/directory\n\n\n      OS X:\n\n      [alt]+[down]                        - select next different file/directory\n      [alt]+[up]                          - select previous different file/directory\n\n\n      For convenience Sublimerge also supports standard OS X keyboard shortcuts for directories navigation:\n\n      [cmd]+[down]                        - enter sub directory / compare text files\n      [cmd]+[up]                          - enter parent directory\n\n\n\n  End-User License Agreement (EULA)\n  =================================\n\n  1.
